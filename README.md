# SHADOWN
Jabs' SHady Ass DOWNloader (SHADOWN). A story of triumph and mental anguish.

 I originally intented this script to download video streams that were broken up into segments (BLOBs) that were pieced together by a .m3u8 file. It still does that. This only difference is now it can do more. This script itself doesn't do the downloading. It merely automates the process. You'll still need 3 programs. Youtube-DL, Wget, and ffmpeg. If you're still here you should already know how to use `apt install`. If you can't get these programs refer to the almighty Google for various tutorials on something that 90% of the time requires one short command. I'm sure someone on stack overflow has been cyberbullied for it at some point by the pathetic neckbeards that lock threads like it gets their little nipples hard. Follow their example.

Option A: This is for videos that are segmented and put back together at runtime by a .m3u8 file. Go into your network tab on your browser of choice. Chrome, Firefox, Internet explorer if you're a mongoloid, Konquerer if you're a masochist. Find an entry with the name `master.m3u8` or something of that same vein. Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V the URL of the file into SHADOWN. Give the script a name without the file extension. Boom, enjoy.

Option B: An automated Youtube-DL script. Honestly this one was a bit of a pain in the arse. Select whether you want to download the video's audio track only for the case of a song or if you want the audio and video. I might implement a video only option Soon(TM). Give it a name without the file extension, paste the URL of the video, pour yourself a strong drink, and ask why you're still alive.

Option C: Wget. Literally just Wget. Dunno why this is here.
